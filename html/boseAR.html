            <p>Commissioned to make a game to highlight the capabilities of Bose’s new AR technology and exhibit the
                game at PAX East.</p>
            <p>Working with a new technology is always very exciting. By being an early developer, I am helping shape
                what the applications for Bose AR will look like. Nobody is familiar with solely sound based AR and
                there are many challenges to work with. The SDK wasn't working entirely and some gestures were difficult
                to record. The design aspect was challenging as well to try to make an experience that will keep the
                user off of their phone UI.</p>
            <p>My team decided to make a collection of wacky minigames to experiment with a wide use of gestures and
                interactions.</p>
            <p>I was the only female programmer out of the 20 people total that were invited to participate at this
                month long game jam. I hope that with my continued work in developing, that it would inspire more women
                to get into game development.</p>
            <p>Presenting the game at PAX East was a great learning experience, because it wasn't just gamers that
                wanted to play the game I worked on. There were such a variety of young, old, experienced, and non
                experience gamers. Since then, I've been more conscious about my design choices, to experiment whether
                anyone can understand it, not just an experienced developer.</p>
