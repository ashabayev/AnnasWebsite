            <p>During Spring of 2020, I collaborated with the Data Driven Design Group at University of Illinois at
                Urbana Chamapaign to make <a href="https://starmap.netlify.app/" target="_blank">STARMAP</a>.
                STARMAP stands for 'Suggestion Tool for Augmented Reality Makers and Programmers.' It is to help
                developers of all skill levels to navigate to wide array of different software and hardware tools
                available for AR out there currently. Our goal was to set up this website and to make it open
                source, so that others could add on to the ever growing list of tools out there for AR.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/starmap/screenshot.png" alt="starmap" class="image"
                style="float:left;width:50%;padding-right: 10px;" />
            <p>When an individual or company decides that they want to incorporate Augmented Reality into their
                projects, they may find themselves overwhelmed. First, they may not be familiar with what is AR even
                capable of. What are the limitations? Does it matter if they choose 3DoF versus 6DoF? Questions such
                as those can be answered in the 'AR Capabilites' page. Next, after understanding what they'd want in
                an AR experience, they can go to the 'Tools Suggestion' page. There, they can check all the features
                that they'd want in an AR hardware or software, and get a filtered list of options in return. For
                instance, if someone knows that they want eye tracking for their application, that can cut down 28
                AR headset options down to 8.</p>

                style="float:right;width:45%;padding-left: 10px;" />



            <p>For this project I took on the role of researching the different AR hardwares and their capabilities,
                and helping to design and program the website.</p>
            <p>I find it amazing at how far the industry has gone with all the different options there are available
                today. But at the same time, it is so chaotic because it takes significant research to understand
                the differences. I believe that it is important for a new AR user to understand what features a
                software or hardware tool may have.</p>
            <p>This project is still ongoing, and I will share the GitHub link for when it will be ready for public
                collaboration. Meanwhile, you can check the current state of the website <a
