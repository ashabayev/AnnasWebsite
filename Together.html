                <p>Together won Best in Gaming at the 2019 Reality Virtually VR/AR hackathon at MIT. Together is a cooperative asymmetrical cross platform escape the room puzzle game. One player is in room scale VR while three other people are playing on their phones to see the same environment in AR. The VR player is the only one able to complete the puzzles, but the AR players are the only ones that can see
            the puzzles. So without using speech, they will need to communicate with each other through body language to solve the puzzles.</p>
                <p>Our team realized that VR can be an isolating experience in a group setting. One person puts on a headset, and everyone else just watches. We wanted to make it a group experience for everyone to enjoy and bond over.</p>
