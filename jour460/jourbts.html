                    It was somewhat challenging to get this footage since there was a pandemic going on. I had to wear a mask at all times, and 
                    be conscious about how far people were away from me to maintain social distancing. At one point, there was a protestor who 
                    was walking up to people on the street to violate their personal space and to break social distancing, so I made sure I 
                    steered clear of them to maintain my safety and the safety of others. Overall though, I am happy to have gotten this footage 
                    since this is a historical event that should be documented to learn from.

                <p>I worked with two different 360 cameras for this project. One being the Insta360 Evo and the other being the Insta360 Pro. Through
                    this process, I realized that the hardward for Insta360 is very nice and dependable however, they are lacking on the software side. 
                    I had to download to seperate programs to stitch the footage, one for each camera. The UI wasn't even consistent accross the two 
                    applications. It would have been better if they could have one software to unite all the cameras to prevent conffusion and frusteration. 
                    To edit in premiere, I believe I had to download two seperate plugins as well. But again, while their software is lacking, Insta360's 
                    hardware is on point.
