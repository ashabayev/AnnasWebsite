                    Welcome to May 2020 during the Covid19 pandemic. According to the CDC, 
                    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html" target="_blank">as of May 11 2020 there are 1,324,488 cases and there have been 79,756 
                        deaths in the United States</a> 
                    which is about 20,000 more deaths than on the US side in the Vietnam War. There are currently guidelines in place 
                    for people to wash their hands with soap and warm water frequently, to wear face masks, and to maintain social distancing of at least six feet 
                    apart from other people. It is also recommended that people self quarentine in their homes. According to  
                    <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/10/politics/unemployment-mnuchin-hassett-kudlow-economy-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">CNN</a> 
                    the US may be reaching unemployment rates of 25% soon, which is around the rates for the Great Depression. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    However, even with all of this going on, life still goes on. People are trying their best to accomadate by working from home, and by modifying 
                    public spaces. I've seen grocery stores with lines leading out of them with markers on the ground every six feet and restricting the amount of 
                    people that can be in the store at a time. One store I've seen had tape sectioning of every 40 square feet or so to remind people not to be too 
                    close together. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some people think that Covid19 restrictions are unreasonable, and that is why there are protests around the country to remove the stay at home 
                    restrictions. People want to get back to normalcy as soon as possible. Right now 
                    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/states-reopen-map-coronavirus.html" target="_blank">there are about 15 states still shutdown</a>
                    , while a majority of the other states are doing partial reopening. However to reopen, 
                    <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/4/22/harvard-coronavirus-hghi-daily-tests/" target="_blank">at least 500,000 tests would need to be done a day</a>
                    , and the United States is simply not there, with testing shortages across the country. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In my videos, I was able to capture some of the ways that people interact during this time. In the airport and Boston, not everyone is wearing a 
                    mask, and if they are, often times I've seen it not being worn properly. In the videos I took, it could be easily mistaken for a quiet part of the 
                    day if it weren't for many people wearing masks. People don't really seem to be displaying worry in the public spaces I took footage in and in the 
                    Boston commons, I barely saw people walk out of the way. This is quite a contrast to my suburban home town, where if someone sees you on their path, 
                    they tend to cross the street to avoid getting close.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I wanted to bring this to Virtual Reality because it is a very different feeling than just watching a video. As the Godmother of VR puts it, “It creates 
                    a duality of presence. You know you’re ‘here,’ but you feel like you’re ‘there’ too. And the experience is much more visceral. It’s really a kind of a 
                    whole-body experience and is very unique – different than radio, than television, than any other kind of format for experiencing a story” (
                    <a href="https://www.digitalethics.org/essays/virtual-reality-journalism" target="_blank">Digital Ethics</a> 
                    ). However, it is hard to capture a scene as it was untouched by the journalist. By placing a 360 camera down, I changed the place and the story I 
                    was telling. The camera was a new character I added to the scene that other people in the scene interacted with. As put by Hollis Kool, 
                    <a href="http://ojs.stanford.edu/ojs/index.php/intersect/article/view/871" target="_blank">"noise by the storyteller’s decisions disrupts the purity of the conveyed reality".</a> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In conclusion, I hope people in the future will have a glimpse of what living during Covid19 was like through these 360 films.
