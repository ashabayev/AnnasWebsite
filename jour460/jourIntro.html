                <p>
                    Welcome to May 2020 during the Covid19 pandemic. There is a stay at home order for all non essential workers to quarentine themselves 
                    as the United States attempts to flatten the curve of Covid19 cases. It is a drastic change from normalcy, and I wanted to know how are 
                    people reacting to it. How has public spaces changed to accomodate for this? How do people interact with eachother when they are out of 
                    the house? I seeked to investigate how public life has been impacted during this pandemic, while keeping myself and others around me safe 
                    as I took a 360 camera around the Chicago airport and around Boston commons.
