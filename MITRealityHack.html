                <p>The Mind's Eye won Best in Eye Tracking at the VR/AR 2020 MIT Reality Hack. It was my first time using eye tracking technology, and I led a team to use the Vive Pro Eye to create an educational game to teach people about how their biases can effect their decision making. </p>
                <p>Being a psychology minor, I've had the idea to make a game around confirmation bias for a while, however didn't have the resources to do it since it required eye tracking technology. So I took advantage of the Vive Pro Eye at the hackathon and developed with it for the first time.</p>
                <p>In this detective game, the player is presented with a murder scene and they need to piece the clues together to figure out who was the murderer and what was the murder weapon. While they are investigating, the game keeps track of how long the player looks at something. The game will then influence the player to go with the object that took their interest with non player characters confirming those instincts.</p>
                <p>There is so much potential in eye tracking with VR, and I'm excited to continue my work with this technology.</p>
